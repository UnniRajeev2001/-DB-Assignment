1. The category_id is foreign key. This relationship allows for the organized storage and retrieval of data. For example, if you want to find all products in a specific category, the database can quickly find the category_id in the product_category table and then find all corresponding products in the product table that have the same category_id. 
   The relation between the product and product_category tables through the category_id serves to categorize products efficiently, ensures data integrity, and simplifies data management by establishing a clear, logical connection between products and their categories.

2. There are  two ways to ensure that the table named product has a valid category. They're Data validation and Foreign Key. Saying about Data validation; We can build data validation rules in the category_id in the table named Product. This restrictds the values that are entered into that column to only those that exist in the id column of the table named product_category.
   About Foreign key; We can create a foreign key relationship between the table named, Product and the product_category. A foreign key is a column in one table that references the primary key of another table, therefore the category_id column in the table named Product would be a foreign key that references the id column in the table named product_category. This would ensure that any value entered into the category_id column must exist in the product_category table.
